                In the summer between my junior and senior years, I interned at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
                in the Simulation Software and Test Bed subteam. As a whole, we were working on the Mars Sample 
                Return mission. Individually, I worked on smoothing out any wrinkles in the test bed. I wrote 
                multiple python scripts that interfaced with pre-existing hardware on the development rack using 
                HTTP requests of XML files. These scripts worked to simplify the use of the test bed. Users could 
                soft reboot, hard reboot, add parameters, define their testing purpose, etc. I also added an 
                aliveness check using a heartbeat ping from the server to the clients to ensure connectivity. 
                These scripts were shared with all other teams to add to their own test beds. This experience was 
                crucial in learning how to work on legacy code, read manuals, and understand what I'm passionate about.
