            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Zoe Cheimets - welcome to my portfolio!
                I'm a University of Michigan alumna with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and I've had the
                privilege of working at Raytheon Technologies, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and on university
                research projects. Now based in Boston, I'm actively looking for new opportunities - especially in
                embedded systems development using C. I'm excited to take on the next chapter of my career and bring my
                skills to a team that's building something impactful.
            </p>

            <a href="/src/journey.html"><h2>My Journey</h2></a>
            <p>
                My journey into computer science began with a curiosity about how things work and a love for
                problem-solving. That curiosity led me to the University of Michigan, where I earned a B.S. in Computer
                Science and discovered a passion for embedded systems and software engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I've worked across a variety of environments—from large engineering firms and government
                labs to academic research teams—each shaping how I approach problems and write code.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Raytheon Technologies, I supported a global internal procurement system, identifying bugs, creating
                user documentation, and training teams company-wide. Later, I joined a U-M research project developing
                an in-vehicle virus detection sensor for Ford, where I built the mobile interface to visualize real-time
                data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was also a project lead on BLiSS, a student team focused on space mission design, where I helped
                develop a simulation to evaluate autonomous 3D-printing of lunar bases. At NASA JPL, I worked on the
                Mars Sample Retrieval Mission, automating simulation workflows and building multi-threaded system checks
                to ensure real-time connectivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduation, I took a year off to recharge, explore personal interests, and deepen my skills
                through travel, reading, crafts, and coursework in circuitry and robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I stay engaged with the field through part-time and freelance work. I teach kids to code at
                CodeNinjas, develop embedded C projects with VataVerks, and build websites for small
                businesses—combining my technical skills with a love for creativity and community.
