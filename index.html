            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Zoe Cheimets - welcome to my portfolio!
                I'm a University of Michigan alumna with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and I've had the
                privilege of working at Raytheon Technologies, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and on university
                research projects. Now based in Boston, I'm actively looking for new opportunities - especially in
                embedded systems development using C. I'm excited to take on the next chapter of my career and bring my
                skills to a team that's building something impactful.
            </p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey into computer science started with a curiosity about how things work and a love of solving
                problems. That curiosity led me to the University of Michigan, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in
                Computer Science. While there, I explored everything from low-level systems to high-level application
                development, and discovered a deep interest in embedded systems and software engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, my career has taken me through a range of environments—from large-scale engineering firms to
                government labs to academic research groups. Each experience has shaped the way I approach problems and
                write code.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Raytheon Technologies, I worked on the company's internal-use procurement system, a tool used across
                the global organization. My role involved identifying and documenting system bugs, which I communicated
                directly to the development team. I also led training sessions for new users, helping teams across the
                company adopt the updated system. In addition, I authored technical documentation outlining system use
                cases and workflows—resources that served both as training material and long-term internal references.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following Raytheon, I joined a research project at the University of Michigan focused on developing a
                sensor
                to actively detect viruses in the air inside Ford vehicles. I was responsible for building the mobile
                application interface, helping to connect sensor data with a user-friendly, real-time display.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my time at Michigan, I was also deeply involved in BLiSS (Bioastronautics and Life Support
                System), a student team focused on space mission design. I began as a team member and eventually became
                a project lead, where I helped develop a simulation to assess the efficiency of autonomous operations in
                a proposed mission to 3D print a lunar base.
            </p>
            <p>
                At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I contributed to the Mars Sample Retrieval Mission, specifically
                working on the simulation environment used by engineering teams to test and validate their systems. I
                focused on automating simulation workflows to streamline project development, and created an aliveness
                check using multi-threaded TCP and UDP programming to ensure constant system connectivity. This hands-on
                experience with real-time systems and hardware interaction is where I discovered my passion for embedded
                systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating, I took a year off to recharge and reconnect with myself after working hard in school
                for over 16 years. During this time, I was able to return to passions and hobbies I had long set aside
                for homework—I traveled, made crafts, read books (see below for my recently read books from GoodReads!),
                and took Udemy courses on circuitry and robotics. This
                year became a valuable period of personal growth, and it gave me the space to reflect on what excites me
                most.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as I look ahead to the next stage of my career, I've stayed connected to the field through
                part-time and freelance work. I teach at CodeNinjas in Waltham, MA, helping kids learn to code and build
                their own games in a fun, creative environment. I also work with VataVerks, contributing to embedded C
                projects that let me continue building hands-on experience with hardware. On the side, I design and
                develop websites for small businesses free of charge, both to support local communities and grow my
                portfolio as a developer.
