        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <img src="/img/IdeaHub.JPG" class="left-img">
        <p>
            My journey into computer science started with a curiosity about how things work and a love of solving
            problems. That curiosity led me to the University of Michigan, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in
            Computer
            Science. While there, I explored everything from low-level systems to high-level application development,
            and
            discovered a deep interest in embedded systems and software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, my career has taken me through a range of environments—from large-scale engineering firms to
            government labs to academic research groups. Each experience has shaped the way I approach problems and
            write code.

            At Raytheon Technologies, I worked on the company's internal-use procurement system, a tool used across the
            global organization. My role involved identifying and documenting system bugs, which I communicated directly
            to the development team. I also led training sessions for new users, helping teams across the company adopt
            the
            updated system. In addition, I authored technical documentation outlining system use cases and
            workflows—resources that served both as training material and long-term internal references.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following Raytheon, I joined a research project at the University of Michigan focused on developing a sensor
            to
            actively detect viruses in the air inside Ford vehicles. I was responsible for building the mobile
            application
            interface, helping to connect sensor data with a user-friendly, real-time display.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my time at Michigan, I was also deeply involved in BLiSS (Bioastronautics and Life Support
            System), a student team focused on space mission design. I began as a team member and eventually became a
            project lead,
            where I helped develop a simulation to assess the efficiency of autonomous operations in a proposed mission
            to 3D print a lunar base.

            At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I contributed to the Mars Sample Retrieval Mission, specifically
            working on the simulation environment used by engineering teams to test and validate their systems. I
            focused on
            automating simulation workflows to streamline project development, and created an aliveness check using
            multi-threaded
            TCP and UDP programming to ensure constant system connectivity. This hands-on experience with real-time
            systems
            and hardware interaction is where I discovered my passion for embedded systems.

            After graduating, I took a year off to recharge and reconnect with myself after working hard in school for
            over 16 years. During this time, I was able to return to passions and hobbies I had long set aside for
            homework—I
            traveled, made crafts, read books (see below for my recently read books from GoodReads!), and took Udemy
            courses on circuitry and robotics. This year became a valuable period of personal growth, and it gave me the
            space
            to reflect on what excites me most.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, as I look ahead to the next stage of my career, I've stayed connected to the field through part-time
            and freelance work. I teach at CodeNinjas in Waltham, MA, helping kids learn to code and build their own
            games
            in a fun, creative environment. I also work with VataVerks, contributing to embedded C projects that let me
            continue building hands-on experience with hardware. On the side, I design and develop websites for small
            businesses
            free of charge, both to support local communities and grow my portfolio as a developer.
