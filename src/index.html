            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Zoe Cheimets. I am a recent graduate of the University of Michigan
                with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Previously, I've worked
                at Raytheon Missiles and Defense, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and in
                University of Michigan research. I am now Boston based and ready to
                begin the next phase of life.

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I am driven by a passion for space exploration and the future of human spaceflight and solar system colonization. 
                My career so far has given me the incredible opportunity to contribute to these ambitions—most notably during my time at
                NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I worked on the Mars Sample Return Mission. That
                summer remains one of the most defining experiences of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my technical background, I find deep fulfillment in helping others. I spend time volunteering at
                Rosie's Place in Boston, and I have also had the chance to bring people together professionally—earning
                an award for organizing a nationwide team bonding activity during my time at Raytheon in the IT Department.
            </p>
            <p>
                After years of dedicating myself to academics, I took a gap year to reconnect with my interests,
                including reading, volunteering, and spending time with dogs. I rediscovered my love of reading, 
                especially science-ficiton and mysteries, but I've lately been branching out into non-fiction novels!
                My current favorite book is "I Capture the Castle" by Dodie Smith.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, my biggest dream is to one day go to space. Until then, I am excited to keep exploring new
                opportunities that bring us closer to that future—both for myself and for humanity.
