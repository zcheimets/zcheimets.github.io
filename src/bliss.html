            <p>
                During my sophomore year I joined a student organization called Bioastronautics and Life 
                Support Systems at the University of Michigan. BLiSS is a research team made up of both 
                undergraduate and graduate students working on designing, building, and testing deep-space 
                habitat prototype technology.

                In that first year, I was a member of the ICON project under Tyler Hudson, who would later 
                become my co-lead, and eventually my predecessor. ICON is a 3D printing company that has 
                recently received a grant to research 3D printing a lunar habitat for the Artemis mission. 
                Our role in this was to build a suite of simulation tools to help them design and analyze 
                their mission infrastructure. Our C# simulation receives tabulated data about a lunar region, 
                a set of robots, local infrastructure, and a mission and simulates the robots completing this 
                mission in the command line. In my junior and senior year, I was a project lead, designing the 
                simulation, leading members of all experiences, and interfacing with our ICON representative.
