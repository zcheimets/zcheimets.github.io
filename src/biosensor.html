            <p>
                During my sophomore fall, I joined a research project working with Ford Motor 
                Company to create a sensor that could report airborne virus levels. The goal 
                was to create a device that could be added to the center console of Ford vehicles, 
                specifically for the benefit of detecting COVID-19 in close quarters, and easily 
                accessible via mobile devices. While the rest of the team worked on the creation and 
                testing of the sensor, I created the app. I adapted code for a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
                sensor to create an AndroidStudio app that polled an Arduino-based sensor and displayed a 
                virus trending graph created with XML. I then worked on designing the user interface with 
                drop-down menus and color-coordinated graphs to improve the user experience and engagement 
                of the app. Be warned, this is my first mobile application project, so it's far from perfect!
